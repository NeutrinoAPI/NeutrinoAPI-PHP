NeutrinoAPILib
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC BETA v2.0

How To Configure:
=================
The generated code might need to be configured with your API credentials. To do that,
provide the credentials and configuration values as a constructor parameters for the controllers

How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses a PHP library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a composer dependency in the generated composer.json
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

How To Use:
===========
For using this SDK do the following:

    1. Open a new PHP >= 5.3 project and copy the generated PHP files in the project
       directory.
    2. Use composer to install the dependencies. Usually this can be done through a 
       context menu command "Instal (dev)".
    3. Import classes from your file in your code where needed for example,
           use NeutrinoAPILib\Controllers\GeolocationController;
   
        
    4. You can now instantiate controllers and call the respective methods.
